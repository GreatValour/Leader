                    <p>Paysafe Group Limited and any of their group companies (together “Paysafe” or “we” or “our”) use
                        “cookies” and other technologies when you use our websites, mobile sites, or mobile apps.
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; This policy applies additional to any other Terms of Use or contract provision for
                        the particular Paysafe service being used.</p>
                    <p>In this policy, we explain how you can control which cookies are used and learn more about
                        cookies and similar technologies. If you want to know more about how Paysafe handles your data,
                        you can find more information in our Privacy policy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Websites: Granting, changing and withdrawing Consent</strong></p>
                    <p>When using our websites, mobiles sites and mobile apps, you will be asked for your consent before
                        we place cookies or similar technologies on your device, unless those cookies are strictly
                        necessary.&nbsp; We use a Cookie Banner to make sure we have your permission to collect data,
                        and a Cookie Preference Centre to allow you to change your mind.</p>
                    <p>Granting consent is simple.&nbsp; When the Cookie Banner appears, click “Accept All”, or continue
                        browsing.&nbsp; If you want to have more control over which cookies we use, you can do so using
                        the Cookie Preference Centre.</p>
                    <p>To change or withdraw consent:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Click “Cookie Settings” on the Cookie Banner. This will take you to the Cookie Preference
                            Centre, where you can select only the cookies you want to be active.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Or:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Click the link to access the Cookie Preference Centre.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>When you first visit the preference centre, all cookies will be switched off, except for those
                        which are strictly necessary. &nbsp;If you have already accepted cookies, the preference centre
                        will show your choices.&nbsp; Selecting “Save Settings” will save your choices, or you can
                        choose to “Allow All” cookies.</p>
                    <p>Please note: if you have deleted your cookies or are using browser settings which prevent cookies
                        remaining on your device (such as incognito browsing, or browser settings which block cookies),
                        you will see the Cookie Banner each time you visit our sites and the preference centre will
                        reset.&nbsp; This is because we use a cookie to remember your privacy preferences.</p>
                    <p><strong>Mobile apps: Granting, changing and withdrawing consent</strong></p>
                    <p>Paysafe mobile apps collect data using technology similar to cookies.&nbsp; This helps us learn
                        how our apps are used and how they can be improved, and also helps to make your data more
                        secure.</p>
                    <p>Paysafe mobile apps contain a preference centre which gives you control of what data we use about
                        you.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>What are cookies and similar technologies, and what do they do?</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Cookies and Pixel Tags</strong></p>
                    <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a
                        website. &nbsp;Cookies are widely used by website and mobile application owners in order to make
                        their websites and apps work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting
                        information. &nbsp;Paysafe use cookies to do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate
                        between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing
                        experience. We also use them to help ensure that any ads you see on our sites and those of
                        others are more relevant to you and your interests.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>We also use similar technologies such as ‘pixel tags’ and ‘JavaScript’ to undertake these tasks.
                        Pixel tags and JavaScript are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable
                        us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites [or opened an e-mail that we have sent
                        them]. &nbsp;This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page
                        within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether
                        you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website,
                        to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. &nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>If you visit our website, mobile site, or use our mobile apps, we will deploy cookies and similar
                        technologies to provide an online service more suited to the device you connect from, as well as
                        to prevent and detect fraud, to help keep you secure. When you visit our website from any device
                        (e.g. mobile device or PC), we collect information about your use of this site, such as
                        information about the device or browser you use to access the site (including device type,
                        operating system, screen resolution, etc.), the way you interact with this site, and the IP
                        address your device connects from. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies
                        to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning, e.g. you may not
                        be able to initiate or complete some activities within our secure online services unless these
                        cookies or similar technologies are installed. Additionally, please note that we may not be able
                        to process certain transactions if you are physically located in certain countries.</p>
                    <p>Cookies set by the website/app owner (in this case, Paysafe Group) are called&nbsp;<strong>“first
                            party cookies”</strong>. &nbsp;Cookies set by parties other than the website/app owner are
                        called&nbsp;<strong>“third-party cookies”</strong>. &nbsp;Third-party cookies enable third-party
                        features or functionality to be provided on or through the website/app (e.g. like advertising,
                        interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise

                    <p><strong>Cookies in Emails</strong></p>
                    <p>We use cookies and similar technology in some of our emails which contain hyperlinks, each of
                        which has a unique tag. They help us to understand a little bit about how you interact with our
                        emails, and are used to improve our future email communications to you. If you click on links
                        contained in this email it will allow us to track your use of our website and enable us to show
                        content and offers of most interest to you.</p>
                    <p>If you do not wish to accept cookies from any one of our emails, simply close the email before
                        downloading any images or clicking on any links. You can also set your browser to restrict
                        cookies or to reject them entirely. These settings will apply to all cookies whether included on
                        websites or in emails. If you have configured your computer to automatically display images, or
                        if you have added us to your email “address book” (or “safe senders” list), or if you have
                        configured your computer to have “weak” security, cookies might be set at the same time as you
                        download, open or read an email from us. If you would prefer for this not to happen, you should
                        disable the automatic displaying of images, or remove us from your address book or strengthen
                        your security settings.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Is there more than one type of cookie deployed?</strong></p>
                    <p>There are different types of cookies which are used for different purposes.&nbsp; We have split
                        them into the following categories, but note that not all these types will be used on every
                        website you visit and some cookies may fit into multiple categories.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;<strong>‘Strictly necessary’ cookies</strong></p>
                    <p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function correctly and cannot be switched off in
                        our systems. &nbsp;They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to
                        a request for services. &nbsp;You can set your browser to block or alert you about these
                        cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any
                        personally identifiable information. They are activated when you visit our website and remain
                        active for the duration of your visit.</p>
                    <p>Strictly necessary cookies can be used to: remember your privacy preferences; allow you to log in
                        or fill in forms; move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas
                        of the website; meet our legal and regulatory requirements, for example, anti-money laundering
                        and fraud prevention; secure your account and prevent it being misused by others.</p>
                    <p><strong>‘Performance’ cookies</strong></p>
                    <p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the
                        performance of our site to give you a better service. They help us to know which pages are the
                        most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies
                        collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not be
                        able to use your experience of the site to monitor and improve its performance.</p>
                    <p>Performance cookies can be used to: record where visitors click on each page and track which
                        services they look for; log error messages from web pages; help improve the websites to make
                        information and services quicker and easier to access on both desktop and mobile browsers.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;<strong>‘Functional’ cookies</strong></p>
                    <p>These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or
                        the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, a website may
                        be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie the
                        region in which you are currently located. They may also be used to provide services you have
                        asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies
                        collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
                        &nbsp;So, basically, these cookies remember choices you make to improve your user
                        experience.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>‘Targeting’ cookies</strong></p>
                    <p>These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also
                        used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the
                        effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the
                        website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this
                        information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or
                        advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation. So,
                        basically, these cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make
                        advertising relevant to you and your interests.</p>
                    <p>If you disable these cookies, you will still see advertising, but it will not be targeted at you.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>‘Social Media’ cookies</strong></p>
                    <p>These cookies are set by a range of social media services where we have added them to the site to
                        enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking
                        your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the
                        content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies you
                        may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.</p>
                    <p><strong>Learning more about specific cookies used by Paysafe Group:</strong></p>
                    <p>To find out about each cookie used by Paysafe Group, visit the Cookie Preference Centre .&nbsp;
                        Clicking on individual cookies will take you to their description in the OneTrust
                        Cookiepedia.&nbsp; Please note that the Cookiepedia is owned and operated by OneTrust and the
                        content is not controlled by Paysafe Group.</p>
                    <p><strong>How does Paysafe work with third parties to show you tailored ads?</strong></p>
                    <p>We work with third parties, such as advertisers, publishers, social media networks, search
                        engines and agencies, to improve the relevance of the adverts we serve.</p>
                    <p>In providing tailored ads we will associate your interactions on our sites&nbsp; with information
                        about how you use your account. We use cookies to collect your information and we do this to
                        gain insights into your interests so that the messages we deliver to you are more relevant to
                        your needs. We do not provide this data to advertisers or to third party sites that display our
                        tailored ads. We simply ask them to display specific ads to you. Advertisers and other third
                        parties may assume that users who interact with or click on a tailored ad or content are part of
                        the group that the ad or content is directed towards (e.g., users in a particular geographical
                        area, or users who purchased or browsed for ‘Skrill Money Transfer’) and thus may infer details
                        about you.</p>
                    <p>Our aim in using these technologies is to provide you with relevant offers and adverts based on
                        the information we hold and your use of our services, including information that others are able
                        to lawfully supply.</p>
                    <p>If you choose to opt-out of targeting cookies in our cookies settings we won’t place any
                        targeting cookies or similar technologies on your device but you may still see adverts, however,
                        these will not be as a relevant to you.</p>
                    <p>If you choose to opt-out of Digital Media marketing in your account settings we won’t use your
                        data to analyse trends in your use of your account, or to improve the way we target users across
                        these platforms in e.g. custom audience/lookalike campaigns where we ask our partners to deliver
                        messages on their platforms to certain customers or share attributes about our existing
                        customers to these platforms to locate similar prospects/leads. Opting out will mean you may
                        still see adverts from us, but again they will be less relevant to you.</p>
                    <p>Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their behalf sometimes use their own
                        cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads, directly to your browser or device,
                        and they may automatically receive an IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to
                        measure the effectiveness of their ads, show you more relevant advertising content, and perform
                        services on behalf of Paysafe.</p>
